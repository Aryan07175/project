this is a data science project.
This project analyzes a dataset of births in the United States to explore trends in gender distribution over decades.

Key objectives:
- Understand birth patterns over time.
- Visualize trends to draw insights about gender-based changes.
A pivot table was created to aggregate birth counts by gender and decade.

Insights:
- Trends in gender-specific birth rates over decades.
- Analysis highlights changes in distribution and total births.

- Changes in the number of male, female, and unknown gender births over time.
  Key findings:
- Gender distribution in births has evolved over the decades.
- Visualizations provide a clear understanding of historical trends.

Future directions:
- Explore additional features like geographic trends.
- Investigate factors influencing gender distribution changes.
